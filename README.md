#Trashme.me
This is the code for the website https://trashme.me a visual dictionary of Italian comedy (or less so) clips to use as fast answers on facebook/twitter/slack/whatever.

## Say what?
An experiment with React (I wanted to play with jspm, server side rendering and routes) to homage the best of Italian pop/trash culture.
